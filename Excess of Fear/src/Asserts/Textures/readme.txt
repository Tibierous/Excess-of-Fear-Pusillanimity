We created this game for the Warick gamesoc 48-hour competition.
The theme was cowardice which can be defined as "execss of fear" or "pusillanimity".

The game we created is a point-and-click adventure.

Upon entering a room you have 30 seconds to clear it of any signs of spookiness before the old lady follows you in.

The game has 2 levels so far - the hall and the bathroom - and 7 more levels are planned, one of which - the attic - is near finished.
